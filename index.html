This photograph is part of Matar’s series <em>L’Enfant-Femme</em> (2011–16). That French expression describes the fleeting preteen and early teen stage when a girl starts to become a woman.</div>

This print portfolio evokes Schutz’s signature subject matter, but translates it to the monochromatic palette of etching. Working with contemporary publisher Two Palms, Schutz created dense, painterly layers of grainy aquatint. Although the ten images suggest a vague story line, the artist left their meaning to the viewer to interpret.</div>

Ganesh drew from <em>Amar Chitra Katha</em>, comics published beginning in the 1960s to introduce Indian children to their cultural heritage. Placing the viewer in an unfamiliar context, the artist uses bodies, space, and history to invite questions about sexuality and power.</div>

I recognize what they are experiencing and make connections between what I experienced some 30 years ago versus what I missed out on in East Cleveland. I have greater aspirations for a better life for my children and all people.” In <em>Bare Arms (The Practice</em> <em>#1)</em> Steward’s skilled draftsmanship and unusual, cropped composition conveys physical struggle in the guise of play.</div>

The artist then builds the structure of her sculptures, using her extensive knowledge of the animals to achieve their lifelike postures. Butterfield accomplishes this effect through the placement of the necks and heads of her horses, which she does last. In <em>Horse,</em> the abstract animal is integrated with the surrounding landscape to evoke the artist’s expansive Montana ranch where she has lived, worked, and kept horses for over 30 years.</div>

In the 1990s, Lamba SARL Studio revived this weaving practice. Its artists create innovative display textiles drawn from extensive studies of historical examples. Using over twelve colors, the many motifs were woven by adding extra weft (horizontal) threads. Its title translates to "stunning with many patterns."</div>

          <div class="list__item__body">To create <em>El Manto Negro</em>, Margolles collaborated with artisans in Mata Ortiz, Mexico, a region known for its ceramic work. The artisans produced thousands of square-shaped ceramic tiles, sourced from deposits at the base of Mata Ortiz’s mountainous zone. Each tile represents a victim of the drug wars that are now rampant in the region; as a grid, they speak to a collective history. <em>El Manto Negro</em> presents Mata Ortiz not only as a site that has fallen prey to violence, but also as a site of artistic productivity that prevails alongside hardship.</div>

Both depict a dancer from the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theatre, founded in 1958 to combine modern dance and African American culture.

          <div class="list__item__body">Polly Apfelbaum’s work builds upon the American abstract tradition of color field, pop, and abstract expressionist painting, while rejecting what she calls the “aggressive masculinity” of these movements. <em>Atomic Mystic Cosmic 16 </em>was stimulated by a year Apfelbaum spent in Italy, when she became fascinated with drapery and colored fabrics depicted in Renaissance and Baroque paintings, as well as the decorative inlay of medieval mosaic floors. For the color, she employed the “rainbow roll” technique, in which multiple colors are partially mixed to achieve a continuous gradient effect. The effect is one of dazzling color and pattern, while also creating spatial relationships that complicate the composition’s hard-edged geometry.</div>

Kessler’s portraits and documentary images capture that transition, depicting students and teachers actively engaged in learning and creating.</div>
